                    Since beginning my journey into programming I have become proficient in Python -- as it was my first language. Then I moved to SQL as it's the pillar of many services' backbone, and after recently becoming entranced by the explicit & powerful nature of the C programming language and its decades of good standing in the programming community.

Lastly, I am pursuing to learn Rust & Go as both are fast and efficient languages which are critical assets for my programming toolbox.

                    As interfacing with a system is the primary way in which we interact with systems, I have familiarized myself with HTML, CSS, and douses of JS. I am hoping to learn React or other popular and industry-standard frameworks in the coming future.
